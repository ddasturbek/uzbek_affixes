# About affixes
In linguistics, an [affix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affix) is a morpheme that is attached to a word stem to form a new word or word form.

In an [agglutinative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language) language, words contain multiple morphemes concatenated together,

but in such a manner that individual word stems and affixes can be isolated

and identified as to indicate a particular inflection or derivation.

[Uzbek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbek_language) is a Karluk Turkic language spoken by Uzbeks. It is the official and national language of Uzbekistan.
